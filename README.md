# 👟 Guess the Footsteps — A Sound Challenge Game

> Created with love, logic, and a little Bridget Velelo flair 💁🏽‍♀️✨

## 🎧 Overview

**"Guess the Footsteps"** is a fun and interactive mini-game that challenges your ears! You’ll hear a footstep sound and have to guess the correct surface — is it sand? wood? water? Or cold, hard metal?

This game was created as a mini creative coding project using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — nothing more, nothing less. Designed to be simple, responsive, and just the right amount of chaotic fun 😎.
